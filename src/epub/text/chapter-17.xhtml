            <h2>Chapter XVI. <br /> Revelation and the Sparrow</h2>

            <h3>1</h3>

            <p>His meal over, he left the flat, going first to a
                District Messengers’ office and then back to the
                garage for his car.</p>

            <p>He knew the road to Marling so well by this time
                that he could almost have driven blindfold, and he
                has said that on this morning he once or twice found
                himself to have been sleeping at the wheel. It is
                certain, anyhow, that he barely saw where he was
                going. Such thought as his tired brain could compass
                was not of murders and murderers, but of Love, a
                Lover and a Lady.</p>

            <p>It was, if one is to believe him, at the cross-roads
                beyond Beachmere that he made up his mind to see
                Her, to drive straight to the house on the bank of the
                Marle.</p>

            <p>He looked at his watch. The hands pointed to ten.
                He settled down in his seat. The needle on the
                speedometer jerked to twenty, to twenty-five; then
                gradually crept on till it hesitated between forty-five and
                fifty.</p>

            <p>His spirits mounted with the speed. The car tore
                her way into Marling and down the cobbled slope of
                the High Street, swung to the left, took the little bridge
                at a bound, raced on, turned the corner next on the
                left after the river bank on two wheels, ploughed up
                the little lane, and pulled up at the gates of the house
                which was graced with Her presence.</p>

            <p>Or should have been. For the parlourmaid
                informed him that her mistress and her mistress’s sister
                were out. For the day, she thought. She was not
                sure, but she imagined the ladies to have gone to
                London.</p>

            <p>Anthony, his fatigue heavy upon him, walked slowly
                back to his car. For a moment he sat idle in
                the driving-seat; then suddenly quickened into life.
                Though their ultimate destination might indeed be
                London, the women would surely stop on their way
                through Greyne. For in Greyne’s jail was Deacon.</p>

            <p>So to Greyne he drove at speed. He missed them
                by five minutes.</p>

            <p>Had Anthony Gethryn been a man of common
                sense he would have returned at once to his Marling
                inn, fallen upon his bed, and let Sleep have her way
                with him. But he was not, so he stayed with Deacon.
                Deacon was obviously—in spite of his flippancy—delighted
                at this visit. Anthony stayed with him until
                two o’clock, when the great Sir Edward Marshall,
                K.C., arrived in person for consultation with his latest
                case, and then set out for Marling. This he did not
                reach for two hours, fatigue and preoccupation having
                cost him no fewer than three wrong turnings.</p>

            <p>At the inn was waiting the reply to the letter
                he had sent by District Messenger that morning. It
                had come, this reply, in the form of a seemingly
                ordinary message over the inn’s telephone. It was
                what he had expected, but nevertheless it made it
                necessary for him to think.</p>

            <p>And think he did, sitting on the hot grass bank at
                the edge of the little bowling-green behind the inn,
                for as long as it takes to smoke one cigar and two
                pipes. Then he sought the bar, to slake a savage
                thirst.</p>

            <p>He ordered a meal to be served at seven. To pass
                the hour that must elapse before this and to throw
                off the lassitude brought on by his fatigue and the
                oppression of the day’s heavy, airless heat, he sought
                the bathroom and much cold water.</p>

            <p>After the bath he felt better. He returned to his
                quarters whistling. Crossing his sitting-room to get
                to the bedroom which opened out of it, he saw
                something he had not noticed when going bath-wards.
                The whistling ceased abruptly. On the table in the
                centre of the room lay an envelope. His name was
                on it, in hurried, pencilled scrawl. The writing was
                feminine.</p>

            <p>He ripped it open, read, and jumped for the door.
                The pink-cheeked chambermaid came running. She
                would not have believed this quiet gentleman could
                shout so loud, nor so angrily.</p>

            <p>Anthony, his lank black hair dishevelled, his long,
                lean body swathed in a bath-gown, towered
                wrathfully above her.</p>

            <p>“When did this note arrive?” He waved the
                envelope in her face.</p>

            <p>The girl fingered her apron. “Oh, sir! It came
                this morning, please, sir. Lady left it, sir. Just
                after ten, it was. Mrs. Lermeesherer, sir.”</p>

            <p>“I know, I know!” Anthony snorted. “But why
                in Satan’s name wasn’t I told about it when I got back
                this evening?” He went back into his room, slamming
                the door and feeling not a little ashamed of himself.</p>

            <p>The little chambermaid clattered downstairs to
                discuss with her colleagues the strange effect of a note
                upon a gentleman before so pleasant.</p>

            <p>Anthony clad himself with speed; then ran downstairs
                to the telephone. The answer to his first call
                was disappointing. No, Mrs. Lemesurier was not
                back; would not be, probably, until eight.</p>

            <p>He rang off, swore, bethought him of his work,
                made sure that the door of the telephone cabinet was
                closed, lifted the receiver and asked for another
                number.</p>

            <p>It was ten minutes before he left the cabinet and
                went slowly to his dinner. He ate little, fatigue,
                preoccupation, and the stifling heat of the evening
                combining to deprive him of appetite. Over coffee
                he re-read his letter. It is a tribute to his
                self-restraint that he had delayed so long. It was a
                short letter, running thus:—</p>

            <blockquote class="letter">
                <div>

                    <p>“<span class="salutation">Dear Mr. Gethryn,</span>—I am sorry you were out: I
                        wanted to apologise for my unpardonable behavior. I
                        can’t think what made me so foolish; and quite see now
                        that you had to talk to Jim and also that he was none the
                        worse for the interview—in fact I hear from Mr. Hastings,
                        who rang up early this morning, that he is ever so
                        much better!</p>

                    <p>“If you are not too busy and would care to, do come
                        and see us this evening. I would ask you to dinner, but
                        we shall probably be late and have a very scrappy meal.</p>

                    <p class="valediction">“Yours gratefully,</p>
                    <p class="signature">“Lucia Lemesurier.”</p>

                    <p>“P.S.—You were rather hard on me, weren’t you?
                        You see, I had asked Dot and she had urged me to go to
                        town!”</p>

                </div>
            </blockquote>

            <p>There is a peculiar and subtle and quite indefinable
                pleasure that comes to a man when the woman he
                loves first writes to him. Soever curt, soever banal
                the letter, there is no matter. It is something from
                Her to him; something altogether private and secret;
                something She has set down for him to read;
                something not to be shared with a sordid world.</p>

            <p>Anthony lost himself in this sea of subtle delight,
                varying joy with outbursts against himself for
                having exhibited such boorishness and for being so
                insanely, so youthfully in love. “For, after all,”
                he told himself, “I haven’t known her for a week
                yet. I’ve spoken with her not a dozen times. I am
                clearly a fool!”</p>

            <p>Unpleasant thoughts broke in upon him. He
                looked at his watch; then jumped to his feet and
                made his way upstairs to his rooms. He reached
                them mopping his forehead. He could not remember
                a day in England so oppressive.</p>

            <p>He took his hat and turned to leave the room.
                As he did so a rush of wind swept in through the
                open window, and a long, low angry mutter of
                thunder came to his ears. Then, with a rush,
                came the rain; great sheets of it, glistening in the
                half-dusk.</p>

            <p>Anthony put on a mackintosh, substituted a cap
                for the hat, and left the inn. He did not take his
                car. Even as he turned out of the yard into the
                cobbled street, the thunder changed from rumble to
                sharp, staccato reports, and three jagged swords of
                lightning tore the black of the sky.</p>

            <p>Anthony strode on, hands thrust deep into pockets,
                chin burrowed into the upturned collar of the
                trench-coat. Incredibly almost, the volume of rain increased
                and increased.</p>

            <h3>2</h3>

            <p>Mr. Poole the butler—Anthony once said that he
                sounded like a game of Happy Families—was in a
                state of nervous agitation verging upon breakdown.
                The events of the past few days had shaken him,
                for some time an old man aged beyond his years,
                to such extent that he would not, he was sure,
                “ever be the same man again.”</p>

            <p>He sat in the little room opposite that which had
                been the master’s study. He shivered with age,
                vague fears, and fervent distaste for the storm whose
                rain beat upon the windows, whose sudden furies of
                wind shook the old house, whose flashes of lightning
                played such havoc with the nerves.</p>

            <p>Mr. Poole was alone. Miss Hoode had retired.
                Sir Arthur was reading in the billiard-room at the
                other end of the house. Belford was on three days’
                holiday, his wife, it seemed, being an invalid.
                The other servants were certainly either in bed or
                huddled together moaning as women will at the
                violence of the storm.</p>

            <p>Mr. Poole was alone. All manner of lurking
                terrors preyed upon him. There were noises. Sounds
                which seemed like the master’s voice. Sounds which
                seemed like the rustling of curtains, whispering and
                soft footsteps. Elusive sounds as of doors opening
                and shutting. Mr. Poole trembled. He knew, his
                fears groundless; imaginings born of the roaring
                rattle of the Universe. But nevertheless he trembled.</p>

            <p>Suddenly there came a knocking on the great front
                door. This knocking was not loud, yet it seemed
                to the old man the more terrible for that. For there
                is always something terrible about a knock upon a
                door.</p>

            <p>For a full minute he strove to leave the shelter
                of the little, cheerful, glowing room. At last he
                succeeded, struggling through the beastly mysteries of the
                dimly lighted hall to open with trembling hands the
                great oak door.</p>

            <p>Anthony stepped over the threshold; stripped off
                dripping cap and mackintosh.</p>

            <p>“A dirty night, Poole,” he said.</p>

            <p>“It is indeed, sir! Indeed it is, sir!” The old
                man’s voice was hysterical with relief.</p>

            <p>Across the hall to them came Sir Arthur, sturdy,
                benign, hair as smoothly brushed as ever.</p>

            <p>“Oh, it’s you, is it, Gethryn?” he said. “I wondered
                who was knocking. You must have very pressing
                business to bring you up here on a night like this.
                Aren’t you wet?”</p>

            <p>“Nothing to speak of. I wanted to talk with you.
                It’s important—and urgent.”</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur grew eager. “My dear boy, of course.
                Where shall we go? Billiard-room?”</p>

            <p>“All right.”</p>

            <p>They turned, but before they had crossed the hall,</p>

            <p>“Tell you what,” Anthony said, “the study’d be
                better. Not so near the servants, you know.”</p>

            <p>“You’re right,” Sir Arthur agreed.</p>

            <p>The study had that queer stillness which comes to
                a room at one time in constant use and then suddenly
                deserted save for the morning activities of a servant
                with duster and broom. It had an air of almost
                supernatural lifelessness, increased, perhaps, by the fact
                that now everything was in its accustomed place; the
                same pictures on the walls; the table; the chairs; the
                very curtains cutting off the alcove at the far end
                of the room hanging in the old slightly disordered
                folds.</p>

            <p>A silence fell upon both men while they found chairs
                and drew them up to the table, under the light.</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur spoke first. “Out with it, now, Gethryn.
                You’ve excited me, you know.” He rubbed his hands.
                “I’ve always thought you’d do something; go one
                better than those damn’ fools of policemen!”</p>

            <p>Anthony leant back in his chair. “This,” he said,
                “is a most unusual business. I said so at the
                beginning, and, by God, I say so now! You might say
                that I have solved the mystery. After I’ve told you,
                that is. And in another way, as you’ll see, it’s more
                of a puzzle than ever.”</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur leant forward. “Go on, man, go on!
                Do you mean to say you actually know who killed
                John?”</p>

            <p>“I do not.” Anthony laid his head against the
                back of his chair and closed his leaden, burning
                eyes.</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur started to his feet. A crash of thunder
                drowned his words. Followed a zig-zag of lightning
                so vivid as to seem more a stage-effect than an outburst
                of nature. Outside, the rain fell heavily, solidly—a
                veil of water. The furious blast of wind which had
                come hard on the heels of the great peal died away
                in a plaintive moan.</p>

            <p>Anthony opened his eyes. “What did you say?
                Before that barrage, I mean.”</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur paced the room. “What did I say?”
                he exploded. “I said that if you hadn’t found out
                who did it, I couldn’t see the use of coming here and
                gabbling about mystery. Damn it, man, we’re not in
                a two-shilling novel! We’ve got to get Deacon off,
                that’s what we’ve got to do! <em>And</em> find the murderer!
                Not sit here and play at Holmes and Watson. It’s
                <em>silly</em>, what we’re doing! And I expected great things
                of you, Gethryn!”
            </p>

            <p>“That,” Anthony said placidly, “was surely foolish.”</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur made impatient sounds in his throat;
                but lessened the pace of his prowling. Under the
                graying hair his broad forehead was creased in a
                tremendous frown.</p>

            <p>Anthony lit a cigarette. “But I may yet interest
                you,” he went on. “You said, I think, that you
                wished to lay your hands on the murderer.”</p>

            <p>“I did. And by God I meant it!”</p>

            <p>Anthony looked up at him. “Suppose you sit down
                and then I’ll tell you all about it.”</p>

            <p>“Sit down!” Sir Arthur shouted. “Sit down!
                God above, you’ll be telling me to keep calm next!”
                He flung himself into his chair. “Here I am then.
                Now get on!” He buried his face in his hands;
                then looked up to say: “You must forgive me,
                Gethryn; I’m not myself. I’ve been more on edge
                the last few days—a lot more—than I’ve let any one
                see. And to-night, somehow, my nerves have gone.
                And when you came with news I thought it meant
                that you’d caught the real murderer and that the boy
                would get off—and—and everything!”</p>

            <p>“I was going to tell you,” Anthony said, “that
                the murderer of John Hoode will never be caught.
                To get him is impossible. Please understand that
                when I say impossible I mean it.”</p>

            <p>“But why, man? Why?” cried Sir Arthur.</p>

            <p>“Because,” said Anthony slowly, “he doesn’t exist.”</p>

            <p>“What?” Sir Arthur was on his feet again at
                a bound astonishing in its agility.</p>

            <p>Anthony lay back in his chair. “I can’t bear it!
                I can’t bear it!” he said plaintively. “You know,
                you’re very violent to-night. I can’t talk if you will
                jump about so.”</p>

            <p>The elder man groaned apology and sat again in
                his chair. His eyes, bewildered, sought Anthony’s.</p>

            <p>Raising his voice to carry above the increasing
                roar of the storm, Anthony said: “Sorry if I seem
                too mysterious. But you must let me elucidate
                in my own way. Here goes: I have said that the
                murderer of John Hoode doesn’t exist. I don’t
                mean that the murderer’s dead or that Hoode
                committed suicide. I mean that John Hoode was
                never killed; is not, in fact, dead.”</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur’s lips moved, but no sound came from
                them. His chair was outside the circle of light
                and it was by the vivid violet illumination of a
                quivering glare of lightning that Anthony saw the
                pallor the shock of his revelation had caused.
                Following that lightning came peal after peal of
                thunder.</p>

            <p>As it died away, Anthony saw that the other was
                speaking. He had not moved in his chair, but his
                strong, square hands were twisting about each other
                to testify to the intensity of his emotion.</p>

            <p>“What are you telling me?” he whispered. “Are
                you mad? John not dead! John not dead! Why,
                it’s idiocy—stark idiocy to say what you have said!”</p>

            <p>Anthony shook his head. “It isn’t. Whatever
                it is, it isn’t that. Wait till I have told you more.
                It’s a long tale and strange.”</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur moistened his lips with his tongue but
                did not speak. Anthony’s words had carried
                conviction; his words and a way he had of commanding
                attention.</p>

            <p>The thunder, after the outburst of a moment before,
                seemed to have ceased entirely. No sudden furies
                of wind shook the house. The only sounds in the
                oppressive room were the tick-tick of the grandfather
                clock and the soft hish-hish of the rain against the
                closed windows.</p>

            <p>Anthony drew a deep breath, and began:—</p>

            <p>“My first impression of this affair was, as you know,
                that it was a straightforward murder, committed by
                some member of this household. Later, I had good
                reason to search this table here, and it was from the
                time of that search that I began to revise my theories.
                In this table I found—as I had expected—a drawer
                hidden from the casual eye. From that drawer I took
                some letters, a collection of newspaper-cuttings, a
                memorandum book, and other papers. You shall see
                them all in due course.</p>

            <p>“The letters gave me my first inkling that there
                was something more obscure about the case than I
                had thought. So I went to the lady who had
                written those letters. From her I got the first pieces
                of the story, not without difficulty. I also went to
                see a man who had once been Hoode’s secretary.
                He was obliging and clever. He had seen things,
                heard things, while he served Hoode, that had
                set him thinking. He thought so much that he
                employed, on his own initiative, a private detective.
                I have seen the detective. The detective, even after
                he was told to drop the business, went on detecting.
                You see, he had become interested. He is not a nice
                man. He smelt scandal and money. He, without
                knowing it, has helped me to piece together the whole
                amazing story—the story which shows how it was that
                John Hoode was not killed.” Anthony paused, taking
                a last puff at his cigarette.</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur, gray of face, hammered with his fists
                on the leather-padded arms of his chair.</p>

            <p>“But the body!” he gasped. “The body! It was
                there!” He glanced wildly over his shoulder at the
                fireplace. “I saw it! I tell you I saw it!” His
                voice gathered strength. “And the inquest, the arrests,
                the identifications! And the funeral! Why, you
                fool!” he cried in a great voice, “the funeral is
                to-morrow. All England will be there! And you tell
                me this absurd story. What in God’s name has
                come to you that you can play pranks of this sort?
                Haven’t we all suffered enough without this?” The
                man was shaking.</p>

            <p>Anthony sat up. “Wait!” he said. “And let me
                finish. I said that John Hoode had not been murdered.
                I did not say that no murder had been done. Murder
                was done. I know it. You know it. The world
                knows it. But what you and the world do not know
                is that the body upon which the inquest was held, the
                body which is to be buried to-morrow, is not the body
                of John Hoode!”</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur glared at him. “What does this
                mean?” he said, and his lips trembled. “What is all
                this? I don’t understand! I—I——”</p>

            <p>Sleep was creeping insidiously upon Anthony. He
                wished that the storm had not ceased. Its
                violence had at least helped to keep one awake, helped
                to conquer this deadly fatigue which made talking
                so great an effort.</p>

            <p>He began again: “The story is this. And though
                it’s as mad as Hatta and the King’s Messenger,
                it’s true. John Hoode’s mother, as you probably
                know, was, before marriage, a Miss Monteith.
                His father, as you must know also, was John Howard
                Beauleigh Hoode. Now, do you know that your
                John Hoode is very like—to look at, I mean—one of
                his parents and not the other?”</p>

            <p>“Yes, yes. He and his father were—well like
                twin brothers almost.”</p>

            <p>“Exactly. John Howard Beauleigh Hoode had a
                way of passing on his features. John Howard
                Beauleigh Hoode was married to Miss Adeline Rose
                Monteith in ’73. In ’72 John Howard Beauleigh
                Hoode’s mistress, the daughter of Ian Dougal—he
                was a smith in Ardenross—gave birth to a son.
                That son, named also John, was maintained and
                educated at his father’s expense; but he turned out as
                complete a waster as any man well could be. John
                Hoode—your John—didn’t know of his half-brother’s
                existence until John Howard Beauleigh Hoode’s
                death. When he did find out—from his father’s
                executors, I imagine—John—your John—was good
                to his bastard brother; and when first he saw him, he
                marvelled exceedingly at this bastard brother’s likeness
                to him, for to look at his face was almost like looking
                into a mirror.</p>

            <p>“The result of his kindness was the expected.
                Ingratitude, surliness, constant demands for money
                and yet more money; finally threats and
                blackmail——”</p>

            <p>“No, no, no!” groaned Sir Arthur, his face in
                his hands. “It’s all lies, lies! I knew John. He
                told me everything, everything!”</p>

            <p>“Not he,” Anthony said. “I’ve all the papers.
                Some of them here.” He tapped his breast-pocket.
                “Birth certificates. Copy of John Howard Beauleigh
                Hoode’s will, and so on. It’s all by the book.
                Well, things went from bad to worse and from worse
                to intolerable for John—your John. These threats—I’ll
                show you some letters later—wore his nerves,
                his health, to shreds. He tried every way of
                kindness—and failed.” Anthony paused to moisten with
                his tongue his parched lips.</p>

            <p>“Finally,” he went on, “John—your John—found
                his work for the State to be suffering. He is, as
                I see him, an upright, conscientious, kindly man,
                but determined. He made up his mind. He would
                help once more, but once more only. He sent for
                the other John. He told him when and how to
                come, how to approach the house, to get into this
                room by that window, all without being seen.</p>

            <p>“The other John came at the appointed time
                and knocked on the window. Your John helped him
                in. The other John, as always, was rotten with
                liquor. Your John told of the determination he had
                come to that this was to be the last time if the other
                John did not amend his ways. Then came trouble.
                Perhaps half-brother was more drunk than usual.
                Anyhow, he attacked your John. Sodden with drink
                though he was, he was the more powerful man.
                But John—your John—managed somehow to tear
                himself free. Not knowing what he did; he picked
                up the heavy poker and struck, not once, but many
                times——”</p>

            <p>“But what—— Good God——!”</p>

            <p>Anthony overrode the interruption. “Wait. Don’t
                speak till I’ve finished. Appalled at what he had done,
                he stood looking down at his bastard half-brother’s
                body. It sprawled there on the hearth in its untidy,
                shabby, mud-stained clothes. It was not, I conceive,
                a pretty sight. Then John—your John—did what
                better men had done before him. He lost his head.
                Completely he lost his head. And he thought at the
                time that he was clever!</p>

            <p>“He locked the door, quietly, as the struggle had
                been quiet. Better for him had the struggle been
                noisy! He stripped to the skin. Then, naked as he
                was born, he stripped that sprawling thing which had
                been his brother. He donned the foul linen and
                musty clothes, the worn-out boots. More horrid still,
                he clad the body in his own good clothing. Carefully
                he did it, even to the tying of the black bow. And all
                the time, beneath his horror, was wonder for the
                amazing likeness of the thing’s face and body to his
                own. For half-brother John was not one of those
                who carry the stamp of their dissipations.</p>

            <p>“Then John—your John—hurried away. Through
                that window he went. As he crouched outside it, he
                heard the door of the room, which he had unlocked,
                open. He peered, and saw his sister. He saw her
                hand fly to her bosom. He saw her rush to the thing
                on the hearth. And he knew that his sister took that
                Thing for the brother she had known and loved and
                cherished all her life.</p>

            <p>“He heard her scream. He saw her sway and
                fall. For an instant sanity returned, and he thought
                of going back to help her. Then fear got him by
                the throat again; fear of arrest; fear of publicity;
                fear of the hangman. He saw it all. And he drifted
                silently away through the darkness. And next
                morning, while the world read about his death, John Hoode
                lay in a Whitechapel doss-house. Later, an officious
                policeman found a carpenter’s wood-rasp and on it
                some blood and some finger-prints. So Deacon was
                arrested for the murder of a man who was still alive.
                The blood on that wood-rasp was not the dead man’s,
                nor were the finger-prints Deacon’s. The explanation
                is long, but I will give it if you like.” Anthony half
                closed his eyes and lay back in his chair.</p>

            <p>A silence fell upon the room.</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur shattered it. He leapt to his feet, his
                virility returned uncannily, a thousandfold. The
                light-blue eyes held fire in them.</p>

            <p>“It’s a lie!” he roared. “It’s a lie!” He smashed
                his fist down upon the table. “A lie, I tell you!
                What’s that?” He turned sharply to face the end of
                the room.</p>

            <p>“What?” Anthony rose to his feet.</p>

            <p>“Nothing, nothing.” He came close to Anthony.
                “What you tell me is lies! All lies! Lies and more
                lies, you——” His voice rose with each word.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, amazingly, Anthony shouted too. “It’s
                true, and you must believe it! Your help is wanted.”
                He thrust his thin, dark face at the other’s. “It’s
                the truth! Truth! D’you understand? I know!
                I know because, because <em>Hoode told me himself—to-day!
                    He’s coming here to-night! Now!</em>”</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur flung his arms above his head. “Lies,
                lies, lies!” His voice rose to a harsh, unnatural
                scream. “All lies! God rot him! Christ torture
                his soul in hell! He’s dead! He’s dead! You fool!
                <em>I</em> know, <em>I</em>, <em>I!</em> You know nothing!” His hands
                seemed to be reaching higher, clawing, as if they would
                tear holes in heaven. “You fool!” he screamed again.
                “He’s dead. <em>I</em> know! <em>I killed him!</em> I climbed down
                and killed him——”
            </p>

            <p>Anthony sat down on the edge of the table. “That’ll
                be all, I think,” he said.</p>

            <p>The curtains over the alcove at the end of the room
                parted. From behind them came three men: the first
                tall and of middle-aged immaculateness, the second an
                obvious detective-inspector, the third negligible save
                for the pencil and notebook he carried.</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur turned, crouching like an animal, to see
                the invasion. In a flash he whipped round and leapt
                at Anthony’s throat, his arms outflung, his fingers
                crooked. Anthony, still sitting, had little time to avoid
                the rush. He raised a knee sharply. Sir Arthur fell
                to the floor, where for a time he rolled in agony.</p>

            <p>The obvious detective-inspector bent over him.
                There was a click of handcuffs.</p>

            <p>The immaculate man advanced to the table. “Very
                good indeed, Gethryn,” he said.</p>

            <p>“Thanks,” Anthony said. “I suppose you’re
                satisfied now, Lucas?”</p>

            <p>“Eminently, Gethryn, eminently!” Mr. Lucas
                beamed.</p>

            <p>“Then that’s all right.” Anthony’s tone was heavy.
                “Now what about young Deacon? Can you unwind
                the red tape quickly?”</p>

            <p>Mr. Lucas leant forward. “If you like,” he whispered,
                “I can arrange for him to get away to-night.
                It’s all very wrong and most unofficial; but I can
                manage it. Speak to the chief on the phone and all
                that sort of thing, you know.”</p>

            <p>Anthony’s face relaxed into a smile. “Good for
                you. You might have Deacon told that if he likes I
                can arrange for the Bear and Key to fix him up for
                to-night.”</p>

            <p>“I’ll tell him myself,” said the other. “You’re
                really rather a wonder, Gethryn! We ought to have
                you as a sort of super-superintendent. Or you might
                do well on the stage. At one time just now you
                almost took me in with that grisly tale and manner of
                yours. And what a yarn it was, too. Just enough
                to make that half-crazy devil think he’d killed the
                wrong man. Enough, I mean, to make him wonder
                whether you hadn’t got half the tale right and had
                only gone astray about who actually did the bashing.”
                Lucas chuckled reminiscently. “I say,” he added,
                “it was a good thing nobody heard us getting in here
                through the window. It would’ve spoilt the whole
                thing. The storm effect helped everything along nicely,
                though, didn’t it?”</p>

            <p>“It did,” Anthony said. “I didn’t arrange that, you
                know.”</p>

            <p>Mr. Lucas smiled. “No, I suppose not; though
                I’m so full at the moment of wonder and admiration
                for the great Colonel Gethryn that if any one told
                me you had, I don’t know that I should disbelieve
                ’em.” He turned to look at the prisoner. “God!”
                he exclaimed. “Look at that!”</p>

            <p>For Sir Arthur was sitting quietly at the feet of
                the plain-clothes man. And he was playing a little
                game with his manacled hands, tracing with both
                forefingers the intricate pattern of the carpet. Every now
                and again he would look up at his guard and laugh. It
                was not a pleasant sound, being childish and yet
                somehow evil.</p>

            <p>Anthony looked, then turned away with a shiver.
                Lucas dropped a hand on his shoulder.</p>

            <p>“Never mind, Gethryn,” he said, after a moment.
                “It isn’t your fault.”</p>

            <p>Anthony shook off the hand. “Damn it, I know
                that! Only the whole thing is so filthy. It might be
                said, I know, that I sent That mad. But it wouldn’t
                be true. He did that himself. Hatred, ingrowing
                hatred of a better man: that’s the cause.”</p>

            <p>Lucas was thoughtful. “It complicates things, this
                madness.”</p>

            <p>“It does. What’ll happen?”</p>

            <p>“Usual, I suppose. The case’ll be tried. He’ll be
                convicted—and sent to Broadmoor, where he’ll die, or
                recover in a year and be let out to kill some one else.
                We’re so humane, you know!” Lucas was bitter.
                “Anyhow, you won’t be bothered any more, except
                for the trial, at which you’ll figure prominently. Oh,
                yes! Great glory will be yours, Gethryn. Think what
                a press you’ll have!”</p>

            <p>Anthony grunted his disgust.</p>

            <p>Lucas went on: “Lord! <em>What</em> a stir this is going
                to make. Millionaire M.P. arrested for murder of
                Cabinet Minister! It won’t be nice for us at the
                Yard either. Not at all nice! Getting hold of an
                innocent man and all that. Police shown the way by
                amateur!” He groaned. “Never mind, <i>The Owl</i>
                shall be the first to publish anything. I arranged that
                before I came down. And then they’ll have that report
                of yours to get out, too. What envy will tear Fleet
                street! Of course, that report can’t come out yet,
                you know. At least, I don’t think so; not before the
                trial——”</p>

            <p>Anthony started. “Lucas,” he said, “there’s
                something we’ve forgotten.” He put a hand up to his
                hair.</p>

            <p>“Gad! So we have. Let’s see.”</p>

            <p>Together they stooped over the prisoner. He looked
                up at them and cackled.</p>

            <p>“Rotten business!” Anthony grunted. “Seems
                almost indecent when the man’s like this.” He put his
                hand on Sir Arthur’s head. His fingers groped for
                a moment; then came away. With them came that
                immaculate head of graying hair.</p>

            <p>“Wonderful <i lang="fr">toupé</i>!” Lucas stretched out his hands
                for it. “I’d never have noticed it. And I thought
                they were always obvious. Well, that’s the last
                confirmation of your theory, Gethryn.” He peered at
                Anthony. “Lord! You look worn out, man!”</p>

            <p>Anthony said heavily: “I am. Think I’ll get back
                to bed at my pub.”</p>

            <p>Lucas glanced at his watch. “Yes, do. Get off
                now: it’s only ten past eleven. Shall——”</p>

            <p>“What time did you say it was?”</p>

            <p>“Eleven-ten.”</p>

            <p>“Gad! I thought I’d been here at least five hours.
                Only eleven-ten! And I’m sitting here!” Anthony
                made for the door.</p>

            <p>Lucas grabbed at his arm. “Here, what’s to do?”</p>

            <p>“Got to go and pay a call.” Anthony wrenched
                himself free and got to the door, paused to say over
                his shoulder: “Don’t tell Deacon to come to my pub.
                Just let him go. He’ll get where I want him,” and
                was gone.</p>

            <p>Lucas stared after him. “Fool ought to be in bed,”
                he muttered. “Clever devil, though, but queer!” He
                turned to the business on hand.</p>

            <p>Sir Arthur still sat on the floor, playing his game.
                His fingers wandered ceaselessly over the carpet. His
                head, bald save for a sand-coloured tonsure, was sunk
                between his square shoulders. Every now and then he
                laughed that high-pitched laugh.</p>
